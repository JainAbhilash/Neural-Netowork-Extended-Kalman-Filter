1) Insert below the student numbers and names of the 1-3 group members, one per line
722472 Ananth Mahadevan 
722074 Abhilash Jain

2) Write below the name of your group
KalmanKillsSGD

3) Write below a short description of the machine learning problem you plan to address
To implement EKF(Extended Kalman Filter) as an optimization technique in a Multilayer Perceptrons and compare the results with traditional SGD based optimization schemes 

4) Write below what deep learning approach(es) you plan to employ in your project
Kalman Filters and Extended Kalman Filters for parameter optimization, Multilayer perceptrons and neural networks in general.  

5) Write below what deep learning software you plan to use in your project
pytorch to utilize the autograd software, optional: a faster numpy implementation only for EKF matrix multiplication tasks

6) Write below what computational resources you plan to utilize in your project
Panniikki Computers, GPUs, Online resources

7) Write below what kind of data you plan to use in your experiments
Regression and Timeseries data such as basic datasets provided in UCI, Eg: Abalone, Bike, Wine quality etc. The datasets are simpler as we wish to understand convergence of EKF for simple networks 

8) Write below what are the reference methods and results you plan to compare against
Training Neural Networks for Classification Using the Extended Kalman Filter: A Comparative Study

A sequential learning method with Kalman filter and extreme learning machine for regression and time series forecasting

Evolutionary Deep Learning with Extended Kalman Filter for Effective Prediction Modeling and Efficient Data Assimilation
